        <p>Recently President Nelson invited us to study the life of Jesus Christ&#8212;His gospel, His ministry, His miracles. In my study, I have appreciated a pattern in the miracles of Jesus. It usually starts with a need: food, healing, help, comfort, peace. Jesus allows individuals the opportunity to use their agency to exercise their faith through action. Maybe it is to <u>fill</u> 6 water pots to the brim, or <u>reach</u> to touch His garment, or <u>wash</u> 7 times in the River Jordan, or <u>bring</u> five loaves and two fishes or <u>look</u> on a brass serpent. Does Jesus really need mortals' help to bring to pass miracles? no. He could do it all Himself, but He often doesn't. Why?</p>
        <p>By inviting us to do something&#8212;bring what we have, start where we are, or ask in faith&#8212;we become invested. It seems that if we help&#8212;even in a small way&#8212;the miraculous experience sinks deeper into our souls and our faith is fortified in a way that wouldn't be accomplished if we weren't involved.  I witness that when we are part of connecting someone to our family tree or helping them make sacred covenants, the Spirit magnifies the memory of that miracle with astonishing clarity, and it finds a permanent place in the fleshy tables of our hearts, and often spills out our eyes. In temple and family history, our efforts are magnified and perfected; we get to come and see&#8212;or come and "bee" part of miracles. </p>
