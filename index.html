        <p>Welcome! You successfully mastered your first task-conquering the QR code! :)</p>
        <p>This page is designed to help you explore and update your view of Temple and Family History work.</p>
        <p>For the next 7 weeks, we will highlight a new "bee-attitude coupled with an actionable idea to connect you with family members on both sides of the veil. This is one of the "sweetest" ways we get to help gather Israel, which is "the most important work taking place on the earth today" (Pres Nelson).</p>
        <p>President Nelson implores us to seek and expect miracles. "Every book of scripture demonstrates how willing the Lord is to intervene in the lives of those who believe in Him...The Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, 'doubting nothing'. Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith."</p>
        <p>There is tremendous power in family history, fueled by the love of--and from-family members. It is a perfect place to expect miracles and feel the love of those beyond the veil "cheering you on today, tomorrow and forever" (Elder Holland).</p>
        <p>So let's get started with some features of Family Search you may not know about but are very fun (and funny) to explore! Click on <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E5a5VTu8DQ0&feature=youtu.be">this link</a> and we'll walk through some together!</p>
