        </div>
        
        <p>Welcome! You successfully mastered your first task- conquering the QR code!;</p>
    
        <p>The next seven weeks are going to be exciting as we explore and expand our view of Temple and Family History work.</p>
        
        <p>Each week will highlight a new bee-attitude and an idea to help you connect with family members on both sides of the veil. This is one of the sweetest ways we get to help gather Israel, which is "the most important work taking place on the earth today" (Pres Nelson).</p>
            
        <p>President Nelson implores us to seek and expect miracles. "Every book of scripture demonstrates how willing the Lord is to intervene in the lives of those who believe in Him...The Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, 'doubting nothing'. Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith." There is a tremendous power in family history, fueled by love of, and from, family members. It is a perfect place to expect miracles.</p>
