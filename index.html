        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>Are you ready to update and expand your view of Temple and Family History work?</p>
        <p>Each week of March, we will highlight a "bee-attitude" coupled with an actionable idea to connect you with family members on both sides of the veil. This is one of the "sweetest" ways we get to help gather Israel, which is "the most important work taking place on the earth today" (Pres Nelson).</p>
        <p>President Nelson implores us to seek, and expect, miracles. "Every book of scripture demonstrates how willing the Lord is to intervene in the lives of those who believe in Him...The Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, 'doubting nothing'. Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith."</p>
        <p>There is tremendous power in family history, fueled by the love of&#8212;and from&#8212;family members. It is a perfect place to expect miracles and feel the love of those beyond the veil "cheering you on today, tomorrow and forever" (Elder Holland).</p>
        <p>Let's start by walking through some newer Family Search features!</p>
